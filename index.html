            <section class="post-content">
                <p><h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Srijan is a 12 year old organisation providing solutions around enterprise web content management and consultation. It's presence is spread across different geographical location from Delhi, Dharamsala and Goa in India to Delaware in USA.</p>

<p>Srijan is serving clients across Asia, Europe, United States and Middle East.  </p>

<h3 id="strengths">Strengths</h3>

<p>Srijan strongly believes in the following idealogy</p>

<ul>
<li>Democracy at work place.</li>
<li>Transperancy.</li>
<li>No heirarchy.</li>
<li>Alignment of personal and professional growth and goals.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone is allowed to express their thoughts, discuss problems and raise issues, which are addressed in the best possible manner. This was achieved by removing the barriers of heirarchy in the company, where everyone is treated with equality.  </p>

<h3 id="workculture">Work culture</h3>

<p>With great power, comes great responsibility. Holding each other accountable to see through the success of a project is the key expectation from each member. While there is no heirarchy, but there are sense of responsibility expected from each role to be performed and fulfilled.</p>

<p>There is a transparent system, which allows everyone to know each other's salary. The concept of openbooks allows any member of the organization to look at the profit and loss account of the company. There is continious 360 degree evaluation system, which allows an individual to improve by working on the areas of weakness.</p>

<p>Srijan also promotes the concepts of the employee owned company by releasing a percentage of share to the members of organization.  </p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The sharing and caring nature of the members of Srijan makes it a unqiue workplace working towards a common goal that aligns with the personal goal. While every member puts in his best effort to acheive excellence, but sometime the goals are not accomplished, As no one is perfect, rather then giving up people learn from their mistakes.</p></p>

                <p><p>In a quest to quench the thirst for technology hunger, derived by the impeccable state of mind to find the peace in life, I chose to be the master in technology for the former and enbraced the cult of a Guru for the latter.</p>

<p>Proud to be the son of a father, who always stood by his principles no matter what and lead simple and dignified life by setting examples with his noblest deed.</p>
